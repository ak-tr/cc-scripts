# üñ•Ô∏è CC Scripts

A collection of Lua scripts designed for **ComputerCraft**. This is just a repository to store all the scripts I have made for my own personal use.

For all the scripts, you may store them as `startup.lua` to force them to launch any time the computer is switched off and then back on. This is especially useful if you don't have a chunkloader mod to keep the chunk the computer is in loaded.
